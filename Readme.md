# fuckCDC 

**A browser extension that automatically answers MCQ and fill-in-the-blank questions on CDC tests because we have better things to do with our lives than 15 fucking tests at once.**

## What the Actual Fuck is This?

Some absolute legend at our college thinks it's perfectly reasonable to dump 15 CDC tests on us while we're trying to survive hostel/home life. This extension is my middle finger to that bullshit.

## What It Does ✅

- Automatically answers MCQ questions
- Fills in blank questions
- Navigates between sections and questions
- Basically does everything except your coding questions (you're on your own for that, sorry)

## What It Doesn't Do ❌

- Coding questions (you gotta copy/paste or write that shit yourself)
- Make your professor less of a pain in the ass
- Fix the education system (we wish)
- **Work on tests with dev tools detection** (those smart-ass systems will catch this extension, so do those tests manually like a peasant

## Installation

1. **Download this extension**
2. **Go to Chrome or any fucking browser you use** (except Firefox)
3. **Load unpacked and select the folder**
4. **Cool, now my fucking extension is installed on your shitty PC**

## How to Use? It's So Easy Bro

1. **Go to a test**
2. **The extension will automatically show all answer keys and coding question answers**
3. **Either mark all answers by yourself like an idiot** 
4. **OR use the "i cant take this anymore" button to automate everything (each section)**

## Disclaimer ⚠️

Look, I'm not responsible if you get caught using this. Use at your own risk. Don't be stupid about it. We're all just trying to survive this academic nightmare together.

## Contributing

Feel free to fork this and make it better. Or don't. I don't give a fuck. It's open source do whatever tf you want with it.
